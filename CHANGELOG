# Release Notes

## 1.1.1 (2020-12-16)

- Hotfix to the `from_json` method that still used the previous API version


## 1.1.0 (2020-12-16)

-   Changed attribute access across all API

Removed some logic in the API that was too complicated.
It was using the `__getattr__` method first to get nodes and attributes,
but it ended requiring extra methods for when you wanted to pass nodes as strings
like graph.node("node") or node.attr("attribute").
I have removed all that and decided to use `__getitem__` instead,
which also prevents attribute clashing with builtin methods.


## 1.0.0 (2020-12-10)

-   First public release
